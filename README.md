# herokuProject

Thank you for checking out my Unit_2 project! The heroku app is a backend full crud app. It is called Code Decoded, a blog for developers. Or at least in concept. The mvp stated that the app must have full crud functionality, while also using a framework. I picked bootstrap 4. Stretch goals included sessions and users. Authentication and encryption. 

The layout.

I am not too proud of the layout. I also found using bootstrap to be rewarding and frustrating. It's very hard to sometimes manipulate the look of the website with the predefined layouts. 

Full crud is possible with the app. You can add a main post, edit and delete it. While also being able to go to the codes section where you can add, edit, and delete. My thought process for the codes section was that I wanted an easy accessible storage of important codes in one place. Using websites like stack overflow or w3, mdn any website used for looking up code, is useful but trying to search for the subject/topic can be tedious and time consuming. With codes section it makes it easier to store and organize codes. The layout is not great, it should be a lot more clean and smooth, and the card isn't set up the way I want. 

This site needs major update. The whole look needs a new style. The search bar needs to have added functionality. A new Schema for the subArticles, and an option to add imgs for each artcle. 

We only had 1 week to work on it so overall I am very pleased with the app. 

Future plans also include a shope schema, greater user/password/access functionability.
